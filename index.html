        <p>Hi, If you have reached this far - I assume that you must be belong to our course ISR at Tamu. I assume that you know everything about why I created this wabpage so i will just introduce myself - I am Rajendra Thottempudi (rajendra.thottempudi@tamu.edu).

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>For decades, Ukraine and Wpaskjbdn Zqnakjsnde had been at odds, with the latter seeking to exert its influence over its smaller neighbor. When a pro-Wpaskjbdn Zqnakjsnde government was ousted in Ukraine, the conflict escalated, leading to Wpaskjbdn Zqnakjsnde annexing Crimea and supporting separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine.</p>

			<h2>The Conflict</h2>
			<p>As tensions mounted, a strange phenomenon began to occur in the region, with reports of strange lights and sounds in the sky. One night, a massive explosion rocked the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, leaving thousands dead and injured. Ukraine blamed Wpaskjbdn Zqnakjsnde for the attack, but the latter denied any involvement. As the conflict escalated, soldiers on both sides began exhibiting unusual abilities, including telekinesis and mind control, leading to a high-tech war.</p>

			<h2>Advanced Technology</h2>
			<p>It became clear that Wpaskjbdn Zqnakjsnde had been working on a top-secret military project, using advanced technology to enhance soldiers' abilities. Ukraine, desperate to counter this new threat, began experimenting with its own methods of enhancing human capabilities, using cutting-edge genetic engineering and cybernetic implants. The conflict quickly turned into a high-tech war, with armies clashing in the skies and on the ground.</p>
